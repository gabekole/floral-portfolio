        toolsUsed: ["Floral knife", "Bud Vase"],
        description: "In this introductory lab, I learned about the fundamental principles of floral design including balance, proportion, and harmony. The goal was to establish a visual line with the bear grass to establish the large pink carnation as a focal point. The minimal materials resulted in an airy and wild structure, with the form and shape being triangular due to the natrual spread of the flowers.",

        description: "This lab challenged me build an arrangement without relying on colorful blooms.The varying textures and shades of green created a surprisingly dynamic arrangement with depth and character. The shape was round with the bounds defined by the large aralia leaf. The arangment was designed to take an ovular form.",

        toolsUsed: ["Floral snips", "Glass vase"],
        description: "Creating this asymmetrical arrangement allowed me to break away from traditional symmetrical design of the previous lab. I focused on creating movement through the placement of cascading elements and varying heights with a lot of negative space between the different elements of the piece. The placements resulted in a ovular form.",

        toolsUsed: ["Floral tape"],
        description: "The traditional corsage allowed for a slightly larger and more layered design compared to the boutonniere. I experimented with combining different textures and layering flowers to create depth while ensuring the structure remained lightweight and secure.",

        description: "Ikebana introduced me to the Japanese art of flower arrangement with its emphasis on minimalism, asymmetry, and the beauty of negative space. The discipline required for this style was challenging but rewarding. I appreciated learning about the significance of the three main lines representing heaven, earth, and humanity, and how their proper placement creates harmony in the arrangement.",

        description: "The hand-tied bouquet technique creates a gathered, natural look that's perfect for weddings and special events. I learned the importance of stem placement and the spiral technique to create structure. The most challenging aspect was maintaining consistent tension while adding stems, but the final result was a professional-looking bouquet with a natural, gathered appearance.",

        description: "Building on the hand-tied technique from the previous lab, this wild bouquet incorporated foraged elements to create a more organic, garden-inspired look. The challenge was balancing the structured technique with the wild, unruly nature of the foraged materials. I enjoyed the freedom this style provided while still maintaining a cohesive design.",
